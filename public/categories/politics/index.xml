      <description>In February 1st 2019, it was found that the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Whatever Northam, had a picture in his medical school yearbook that contained a person in black face and another person wearing a Klu-Klux-Klan hood. Many people of all party affiliations called for his immediate resignation. By February 3rd, 2019, Northam had not yet resigned.
There was, of course, a lot of debate on social media.</description>
