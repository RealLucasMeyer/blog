      <description>Florida has nice weather most of the time, but also has extreme weather occasionally.
Hurricane Irma happened when I was out on a business trip, and my family was in Parkland, FL. Forecasts went from &amp;ldquo;maybe it will hit you&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;if you stay you&amp;rsquo;ll surely die&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;I think it&amp;rsquo;s not going to hit you anymore&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Phew, it will miss&amp;rdquo; in four days.
We did a lot of preparation using conditional probabilities.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this on 2018-02-26, after thinking a lot about guns after the Parkland School Shooting, but I&amp;rsquo;m burying this article in the past because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of passion around this topic.
 I live in Parkland, FL, and I have three kids. When the Parkland School Shooting happened, my kids were in elementary school, and out of danger. Many of our friends and their kids were not so lucky as we were.</description>
