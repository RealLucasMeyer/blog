      <description>My father passed away a few years ago. I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember exactly when. I think it was in 2013 or 2014. We were not close when he died, and I don&amp;rsquo;t remember ever being close. To my memory, he was mostly away since I was around 7, and he left home for good when I was 13. Not having a father made a lot of things harder in my life, which I imagine made me more capable in some respects.</description>
