When I was (a lot) younger, one of my favorite things was to read old predictions made by psychics. They were easy to find: in Brazil, most of the magazines in dentist offices and barbershops are quite old, sometimes 2-3 years. So in 1995 it would be easy to walk into a barbershop and find the magazines from 1992 predicting 1993 and so on. As expected, most psychics are really, really bad forecasters.

One of the interesting things, however, is that they essentially subjected themselves to a pre-registered experiment. They would publish their predictions in 1992 about 1993, and at the end of 1993 one could easily verify their accuracy. That always struck me as odd - it doesn't seem to be a good business practice if you're a psychic. Maybe they **really** believed in their powers, or maybe they knew their customers wouldn't care. 

One downside is that (of course) they didn't provide confidence levels on their predictions - their confidence was assumed to be 100%. For a pre-registered somewhat more scientific forecast, it's better to provide confidence levels.
